Analysis:

For my Stack<T> clear() function, the worst-case run-time complexity would be
O(n), where it would have to walk through the container each array element at a
time to call a destructor on each array element object. This makes the
complexity linear in size. An array of primitive types, though, would be
constant in run-time complexity, as the array could just be deleted in one step.
However, this is simply not always the case.
